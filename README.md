## UML Diagrams

### Controller
<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;">
    <img src="controller.jpg" alt="Controller" width="1000">
  </div>
  <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
  The controller is built up in a DAO (data access object) pattern fashion like way, where the classes of the impl holds all the implementations to acquire data from the sql database. 
  </p>
</div>

### Model
<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;">
    <img src="model.jpg" alt="Model" width="1000">
  </div>
  <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
  The model holds data for the different tables in the database.
  </p>
</div>

### Viewer
<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;">

  </div>
  <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
    <ul>
      <li><h3>The view that the user sees when logging in is defined in Loginviewpane.</h3></li>
      <li><h3>After logging in, the view will be split up into a MainViewPane, which is a BorderPane+AnchorPane combination.</h3></li>
      <li><h3>The top will be a toolbar, and the center will contain whatever view the user navigates through.</h3></li>
      <li><h3>This view is set with the <code>updateContent</code> function in <code>mainViewPaneInterface</code>.</h3></li>
      <li><h3>The interface of the main view is injected around and used throughout the application to update the content in the center.</h3></li>
      <li><h3>It is also utilized for toasting the user, stacking toasts on top of eachother in a VBox in the Anchorpane bottom left corner. </h3></li>
    </ul>
  </p>

## Installation and Configuration

### Prerequisites
- Make sure you have OpenJDK >= 21 installed.
- Have a database ready and note down its URL, username, and password.

### Steps

#### 1. Clone the Repository
First, you need to clone this repo.

#### 2. Copy Configuration Template
Open the configuration template file located at `/app/config.properties.template` in a text editor of your choice, and copy all the contents.

#### 3. Create Configuration File
In the same directory as the template file, create a new file named `config.properties`:

#### 4. Paste Configuration
Open the newly created `config.properties` file and paste the contents you copied from `config.properties.template`.

#### 5. Database Dump
In the root directory of your project, you will find a database dump file named `CRUDrecipesDBSnapShot.sql`. This file can be used to set up your database schema.

#### 6. Update `config.properties`
The `config.properties` file needs to be updated with your database information. Open `/app/config.properties` and:
- Locate the line `database.url=` and set it to your database URL, e.g., `database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/yourDatabaseName`
- Locate the line `database.user=xxx` and replace `xxx` with your database username, e.g., `database.user=myDatabaseUser`
- Locate the line `database.password=xxx` and replace `xxx` with your database password, e.g., `database.password=myDatabasePassword`

### Example Configuration (`config.properties`)
Here's an example of what the `config.properties` file might look like:
```
database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/yourDatabaseName
database.user=myDatabaseUser
database.password=myDatabasePassword
```

### Running the Application
After setting up the configuration, you can build and run your application with Gradle.
Please note, the default login for admin is `admin : admin123`

1. Build the project:
   ```
   ./gradle build
   ```

2. Run the project:
   ```
   ./gradle run
   ```

## Screenshots

### Welcome Screen
<img src="/Resources/login.gif" alt="Login" width="600">

**On startup of the cookbook application, you are welcomed with a login screen. After a successful login, the stage is closed and a new one is opened.**

### Recipe Overview
<img src="/Resources/recipeScrollPane.gif" alt="Display all recipes" width="600">

**After successfully logging in, the user is presented with a scrollable, tiled view of all recipes. Hovering over a recipe reveals a longer, more detailed description provided by the recipe's author. Below each recipe are tags assigned by the author.**

### Search
<img src="/Resources/search.gif" alt="Search a recipe" width="600">

**If a user doesn't immediately find a desired recipe, a quick search can help them find one that suits their taste or matches the ingredients they have at home.**

### Favourites
<img src="/Resources/favourite.gif" alt="User Favourites" width="600">

**If a user likes a recipe, they can add it to their favorites by clicking the star. They can later view all their favorites by clicking the star in the search component.**

### Detailed Recipe View
<img src="/Resources/recipeView.gif" alt="Display a specific recipe" width="600">

**When a user finds a recipe they like, they can click on it to view detailed descriptions of the required ingredients and the steps to follow.**

### Personal Tag view.
<img src="/Resources/tag.gif" alt="personal tag view" width="600">

**Users can change color and name on their tags.**

## Project status
The project is no longer active but there are further improvements and missing features to be implemented

Further improvements and missing features:
- Welcoming animation
  - The application should start by showing a short little animation and then let the user log in.
- Weekly Dinner List
  - As a user I want to be able to create weekly dinner lists for several weeks so that I can display them later
  - As a user I want to be able to see the list of weekly dinner lists
  - As a user I should be able to select and display the dinner list for a week
  - As a user I want to add dishes to created weekly dinner lists (one, two or more dishes per day)
- Shopping List
  - As a user I want to be able to generate a shopping list with what I need to by for a week
  - As a user I want to be able to modify the shopping list so that it does not contain things I already have at home
- Sharing recipes
  - As a user I want to be able to send a recipe to another user so that he/she can cook it
  - As a user I want to add a message to a recipe that I send to another user to inform why I did it
- Help system
  - As a user I want access to a help system with a tutorial of how the program works so that I can understand how to use it
- Save reminder
  - When the user edits or creates new tags or ingredients and tries to navigate to another page there should be a reminder to save changes.
- Breadcrumbs
  - To improve the user experience when navigating the application would be a page back button
- General UI improvements
